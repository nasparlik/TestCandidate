# Candidate Coding Test

Take a look over the code in this repo. When you come into the office for an interview you will have a 45 minute pair programming session to complete some tasks based on this project.

### The Code
The application you will be building is a questionnaire. There is a Web API Service in the solution which will provide you with the questions. The solution uses a hardcoded/mocked repository to avoid using a real data source.

It is expected that you will produce:
* Tested maintainable code
* Clean code and OOP design
